# TwitFaceTagram

## About

- TwttFaceTagram was a project I wanted to build after learning GraphQL/Apollo and Next.JS.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- URQL/Apollo
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- TypeORM
- Redis
- Next.js
- TypeGraphQL
- Chakra UI

## Starting the Web App

```bash
$ cd client
$ yarn dev
```

## Starting the server

```bash
$ cd server

$ yarn dev
```

- if there's an authentication error when starting the server you will need to use your password for logging into pgAdmin.

```bash
$ PGPASSWORD=[insert your password here] yarn dev

```

## Build Progress

- So far I'm the only person build the app at the moment and I'm currently building out more of the Front-End and making some tweaks to the Back-End.
